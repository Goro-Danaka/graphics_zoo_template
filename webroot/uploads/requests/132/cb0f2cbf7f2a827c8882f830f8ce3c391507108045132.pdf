Business owners are now free to use <a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/244677" style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline">various social media platforms</a> such as Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, and Twitter to sell, market, and reach out to customers of different demographics. Therefore, it is time to join the bandwagon if you have not yet utilized free advertisement of your brand through social media. </span></span></p>\n\n<p style="margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in"><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif"><span style="font-size:16px">Social media branding is one area that you should pay extra attention to if you are planning to attract a large following from your clients. Our brains understand and interpret visual images faster than words, so you need to maintain a high standard on the designs that you place on your feeds. This blog will guide you through secrets that leading companies like Coca-cola have used to retain their position in global markets.</span></span></p>\n\n<p style="margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in"><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif"><span style="font-size:16px"><strong>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Choose the Right Networks</strong></span></span></p>\n\n<p style="margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in"><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif"><span style="font-size:16px">It may appear sensible to use all social media platforms to market your brand, but the choice of some specific channels attract a large following than others. For example, Pinterest will be a right fit for a fashion brand while a real estate company may enjoy connections from LinkedIn. You may have a challenge in making progress with your brand if you choose the wrong social media channel for your business. </span></span></p>\n\n<p style="margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in"><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif"><span style="font-size:16px"><strong>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Consistency is the Key</strong></span></span></p>\n\n<p style="margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in"><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif"><span style="font-size:16px">No one is going to take you seriously if your logo design appears different on various social media sites.

A designer working on your <a href="https://www.inc.com/aj-agrawal/importance-of-consistent-branding-across-social-media-platforms.html" style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline">social media pages should maintain consistency</a> in colors, tones, fonts, and styles used on all platforms. Remember that most social media users are more likely to pay attention to visual content on a page than the words, so you should aim at using a design that they will recognize instantly. </span></span></p>\n\n<p style="margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in"><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif"><span style="font-size:16px"><strong>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hire a Professional Graphic Designer </strong></span></span></p>\n\n<p style="margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in"><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif"><span style="font-size:16px">A professional graphic designer aims at telling a story to your clients through their designs.

Everyday updates increase your chances of getting more followers and influencing more customers. You should have knowledge on when to post to attract most shares and likes. For example, posting content between 1 pm to 5 pm will attract more shares than posting early morning.

Technology is one of the hardest topics to ignore due to its influence on significant aspects of our lives. Its effect on graphic design is quite significant following the major transitions from the old designing methods of using paints and typewriters to cooler trends such as Adobe Photoshop and Autodesk Maya. Just like any other changes, <a href="https://studymoose.com/what-impact-have-digital-technologies-had-on-the-graphic-design-industry-essay">the technological changes in graphic design</a> have stirred mixed reactions among most designers. Some old developers in the industry argue that technological evolution is the cause of diminishing creativity and low quality work among designers. The biggest majority including the Graphics Zoo designers feel that technology propels the designing industry by reducing the time spent working on one project and allowing easy marketing.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif">It is easy to understand how technology influences the way designers work and how they present their designs. The analog developers have been talking about the downsides of technology arguing that it kills the creativity and lowers the value of designing. The narrative remains the same until they get to enjoy the efficiency, high productivity, and smooth flow of work from 21st-century designing and the story changes. I also do not think that anyone would choose to use the tedious kneaded erasers and typewriter over the exiting 3D printers and graphic tablets. We will go through other ways below in which the <a href="https://www.ukessays.com/essays/media/thesis-technologys-impact-on-graphic-design-media-essay.php">technological advancements affect the graphic design</a>.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif"><strong>1. &nbsp; &nbsp;Effect on Communication Method</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif">Reliance on the word of mouth and print media in publicizing various models was not only common to the analog designers but also limited the number of people that they could reach out to. Almost everyone in 21st century owns a social media account. This means that the graphic designers of the present day have access to a large pool of customers. You may have noticed various ads on social media with varying sizes and content and wondered why you would not find some of those on print media. This is because websites and social media sites open doors to different types of ads ranging from large corporate covers to small updates of your favorite fashion magazine.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif"><strong>2. &nbsp; &nbsp;Improved Quality</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif">Technologically advanced gadgets such as graphic tablets are not only cool but also fast to operate than the manual items such as typewriters. You are sure of finer quality and exposure to more graphics while working with software and powerful devices that can handle different designs, resolutions, and colors. It is also interesting working with programs such as Quark Express and Adobe Photoshop to create complex and detailed digital pieces deemed impossible to achieve a few years ago.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif"><strong>3. &nbsp; &nbsp;Higher Productivity</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif">Every industry thrives on the productivity of workers, and so is graphic design. It must have been boring and tedious for early graphic designers who had to go through the process of arranging the composition of models, developing design mocks, and cutting out the pages. Nowadays, you need to swipe from your tablets before drawing the sketches against an image program and voila. You can also send the designs to the clients and get feedback in a short time.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif"><strong>4. &nbsp; &nbsp;Fast Feedback</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif">Use of social media and website is much more common in the 21st century than it was before. Millions of people use social media every hour meaning that a designer can get a review and an honest opinion from various people online. You can, therefore, seize the moment and identify your weak points as well as learn from other developers. Remember there are numerous predators online hunting for the best designs, so you should be careful while submitting your work to various sites.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif"><strong>Conclusion</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif">Every developer will always remain grateful for the numerous graphic tools despite the increasing number of amateurs using them to submit poor quality designs.

(13, '4 Designing Tactics That Will Strengthen Your Brand', '<p><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif">What impression does your website create to your visitors? The appearance of your website determines the number of visitors that you receive each day. There is an old saying that states, &ldquo;You cannot the judge the book by its cover,&rdquo; but times are changing where people now use websites, and they will certainly judge it by its design. Your brand and company have a story to tell, and you should make it as interesting as possible. There are plenty of amateurs in the market today, but only a highly trained and skilled professional graphic designer understands the various tactics that they can use to strengthen your brand. Getting a designer who will provide high-quality work can be a daunting task, but the hassle is worth it. Some of the designing tactics that a professional should consider using while designing or redesigning include:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>1. Giving a Clear Definition of Who You are and Your Product Offering</strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\nEveryone is defining who they are and what they do, but what is it that attracts one client to one website over the other? Psychology is an important aspect of designing since the choice of one color or font over another may have a different meaning to a person visiting the site. A unique and inviting home page should contain a clear definition of who you are and the services your company provides. Your relationship with your clients also determines the number of people visiting your site. Your content and product description should be written in a way that it speaks directly to your customers.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>2. Invest in a Good Name </strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif">What comes to your mind when the name Bill Gates comes up? I am sure the world richest man was one of the few ideas that struck your mind. This is the same case with a website name. A professional graphic designer will always advise a client to choose a unique name that carries the weight of its own. Let us take Graphics Zoo for example; the name itself gives you the idea of the services that company offers. You may choose to use your name, but you should understand that this might pose challenges in future in case you intend to sell the company. Therefore, the choice of a strong name without a mark is one of the tactics that you can use in promoting your brand.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>3. Be Animated </strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif">Animations and use of GIFS is a trend that is taking the internet with a bang.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Everyone likes juggling their minds over the various creations on the website. Not only are the animations essential in creating an attractive contrast but they will help you giggle after seeing one. I am sure no one hates watching an exciting thing before getting to serious business. You just have to use the animations sparingly and align them with the content on your site.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>4. Consistency is the key </strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf the last time you updated new content on your website was more than six months ago, then you should review your consistency markers. You might have taken years developing your brand, and growing your network. This means you will do anything to avoid any single moment of inconsistency on your website. A graphic designer should consider updating their content occasionally if they intend to remain in the market for a long time. Conclusion Numerous graphic designing tools are entering the markets every day hence allowing anyone to design. Knowledge of the tactics above will help improve your brand and help it stand out from your competitors. You may choose to allocate the designing duties to one of your employees, but it is advisable to hire a professional graphic designer who will help in placing your brand higher up in the market. Our experts at Graphics Zoo are ready to help you develop your brand from scratch through our designing capabilities.

Therefore, you should invest more time and energy in choosing the right designer that suits your company needs. There are many freelancers and designing companies today, but <a href="http://www.marketingprofs.com/opinions/2013/23974/hiring-a-graphic-designer-first-ask-these-eight-questions">choosing a right one</a> who suits your need might be a little bit challenging to a company owner. Hiring the right person for the job may require some knowledge of designing to prevent you from paying more for a job that would have only used a few dollars. In this blog, we will go through the key questions you should ask any prospective graphic designer before hiring them.</span></span></p>\n\n<ul>\n	<li><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif"><strong>Cay I see your Design Portfolio?</strong></span></span></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif">A portfolio should contain samples of the designer&rsquo;s previous work that falls within your price range. Asking to see the designer&rsquo;s previous work gives you an idea of what you are likely to get in your designs. Most designers usually follow a common design method, so your project might be similar to the previous ones that they have designed before. You may consider talking to the previous clients and enquiring about their experience with the graphic designer or his company.</span></span></p>\n\n<ul>\n	<li><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif"><strong>Which Team is working on My Project?</strong></span></span></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif">This question is important while you are intending to hire an agency to complete your task. Hiring an agency over a freelancer is essential especially if your project is complex and requires different kinds of expertise for example copywriters, graphic designers, and programmers. You may want to enquire on the team that will complete your work including their titles, names, and level of expertise. This allows for a more direct communication about the progress of your project.</span></span></p>\n\n<ul>\n	<li><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif"><strong>Can You Take me Through the Designing Process?</strong></span></span></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif">You may not understand most terms and activities performed while designing but a designer should be in a position to explain them to you. The systems and processes that a designer uses determine the quality of work that they produce. A professional developer should make the process clear and easy to understand despite the complexity involved in the designing. Be on the lookout for any developer who has trouble describing the processes, &nbsp;since there is a high likelihood they do not have the skill set required to complete the job.</span></span></p>\n\n<ul>\n	<li><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif"><strong>Who Owns the Copyright after Completion of Design</strong></span></span></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif">You should always remember to ask about copyright and licensing rights before you hire a designer. Some graphic designers may not be willing to surrender the copyrights and any other digital copies while others do not have a problem with that. Make it clear that you will be willing to get the copyright and remain in possession of digital copies as well as source files as soon as the completion of the project. You can now freely make changes to the designs in future without seeking any permission from the original designer.</span></span></p>\n\n<ul>\n	<li><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif"><strong>How long will it take to develop a Design?</strong></span></span></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif">The time taken to deliver a design depends on its complexity, the number of designs, and team members of working on it. An experienced designer has knowledge on use of various technology and tools hence giving a good estimated time. One indicator of a designer who can work on a tight deadline is his responsiveness to phone calls, emails, and submission of proposals.</span></span></p>\n\n<ul>\n	<li><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif"><strong>Do you intend to Use the Royalty Free or the Custom Designs?</strong></span></span></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif">A graphic designer will charge more for a custom design. However, a custom design reflects the services and operations run by your company. It also has a lot to offer in terms of flexibility and texture. You should consider asking the designer to show you some of the illustrations they intend to use to complete the work. Remember some of them charge an extra fee for the illustrations, so you should enquire about that before going on with the illustrations.</span></span></p>\n\n<ul>\n	<li><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif"><strong>How much Do You Charge for the Services?</strong></span></span></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif">Graphic designers may give you an hourly rate while others will always have a fixed charge upon completion of the project. Remember that cheap may be expensive, so it is better to get a good price range depending on the services provided. Some factors such as the rights usage, the number of designs required, revisions and the complexity of designs might have a direct impact on the overall price. Sometimes the graphic designer may give you a maximum of two revisions before charging an hourly rate on any other additional revision.</span></span></p>\n\n<p><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif"><a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/graphic-designer-interview-questions">Hiring a graphic designer</a> is not a difficult task but you should be cautious about the person you entrust with your company&rsquo;s reputation.

Gone are the days where you would carry a bag full of your past designs to an interview.

This means a boring and outdated brand may not do well in the current world. <a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/283126" style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline">Rebranding</a> is essential for any company looking to remain competitive in the market. It boosts your marketing efforts since by enabling you to reach a larger audience. It is also a sure way of separating from a big pool of clients rendering you unique and top in the industry. However, rebranding might cost you a lot in your business if you do it at the wrong time. </span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in"><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif">Rebranding has always received mixed reactions from staff and consumers. Most business owners see it as a daunting and complicated task, but all this is nothing compared to the risks involved in sticking to the old designs. A good example of a brand that lost a large client following is Microsoft by staying for over 25 years without rebranding. At this time, Apple was growing at an alarming rate, and before Microsoft realized, the new brand had already established its roots and was flying high in the markets. Companies and big household names like Coca-cola, Pepsi, and Nike have had to rebrand severally to maintain their competitiveness and relevance in the industry. These are some of the few incidences when rebranding was important for a company.

If your brand used to target the elderly and you just changed your target audience, then you may consider rebranding. The rise of other brands targeting audience of a particular demographic might come out very strongly, and this calls for rebranding to remain competitive.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<ol start="2">\r\n	<li><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif"><strong>When you outgrow your Former Mission and Values</strong></span></span></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p style="margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in"><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif">A business should have a clear plan of current and future activities. If you are no longer serving your original purpose as you used to a few years ago, then it is a clear indication you need a rebrand.

Most business owners acquire other competing companies. This means that the new clients of the company you merged may have chosen the company over yours. It would be unwise to realign the new business&rsquo;s goals with your parent company without taking note of the brand image portrayed by a subsidiary. Therefore, rebranding would be one of the best options for you to retain royal customers from both businesses. </span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<ol start="4">\r\n	<li><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif"><strong>When Looking to Distinguish Yourself from Your Competitors</strong></span></span></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p style="margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in"><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif">Competition is inevitable in every business, but the way you present your brand determines your outcome. Big companies like Coca-cola understand that it is important to rebrand after every 7-10 years for them to beat the competition in the industry. This has made them unique even with other brands coming to the market every day. If your competitor brand has a message and graphics that resemble yours, then you should consider rebranding to avoid confusing your clients. </span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<ol start="5">\r\n	<li><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif"><strong>When Looking to Repair a Damaged Online Reputation</strong></span></span></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p style="margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in"><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif">A damaged reputation is sometimes hard or even impossible to fix, and it may cost you a lot in term of sales and client trust. Some people may relate various brands with negative occurrences such as gangs and drugs. In this case, a rebrand would help save your company&rsquo;s image and reputation. You might just need a little change in the design and the logo, but some worst incidences require a detailed change of brands&#39; name and the look of a company. </span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in"><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif">Rebranding requires proper timing and planning.

They have to go through the hassle of getting permits, insurance cover, and hiring new employees. The hiring process is even more daunting for the newcomers in business since they do not know the ideal person to employ during the company&rsquo;s developmental stage. Some business owners would ignore the <a href="http://www.infoentrepreneurs.org/en/guides/use-design-in-your-business/" style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline">role of graphic designers in a new business</a>, but they are among the core driving engines in any business. </span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in"><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif">It is important to hire a designer if you intend to command a large following from the first day you launch your brand. A designer plays a significant role in developing the brand culture, increasing its awareness, and introducing the product to new users. Remember that first impression goes a long way in determining the popularity of your business. Therefore, appealing and professional content is the way to go to attract a large client base. Below are some reasons for hiring a designer before you even launch your business. </span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in"><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif"><strong>A Graphic Designer Can Create a Logo for your Business </strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in"><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif"><a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/245972" style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline">A logo</a> is a representation of your company. You may want to consider hiring an expert to design a professional logo rather than allocating the job to anyone. A designer will have the knowledge and experiences needed to create a memorable logo that is functional across most platforms. </span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in"><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif"><strong>A Designer Helps Increase the Popularity of a Brand</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in"><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif">All new businesses aim at increasing their demand in the market. A professional designer who has previously worked with different companies understands what your business requires in order to improve their client following. The designers are not only popular in making graphics, but they also play a major role in driving the product vision as well as marketing the company&rsquo;s items to a large customer base. Attractive and professional designs are highly likely to receive more customers compared to the low quality and unimpressive ones.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in"><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif"><strong>It Is A Sure Way Of Winning New Clients And Markets</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in"><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif">New designs should touch the heart of people visiting a website and always keep the customer interested. Therefore, you can consider hiring a designer to keep your site up to date with the current trends in the markets. Graphic designing involves balancing the colors, fonts, and texture among other things to come up with high-quality designs. This means that a customer is highly likely to subscribe to a website that portrays a high level of creativity and proper coordination of colors, fonts, and styles. </span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in"><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif"><strong>A Graphic Designer Helps You Create A Good First Impression</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in"><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif">The first impression is important when launching your brand. Your prospective clients will always perceive your brand according to the first image they see or the logo on your pages. A graphic designer helps in developing unique and creative designs that always keep the clients interested. Remember you are dealing with a new business, which has not yet established their place in the market or gained enough customers to keep your company running. Therefore, you should maintain an attractive appearance to maintain the users around your brand for a long time.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in"><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif"><strong>Bottom Line</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in"><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif">It is evident that a graphic designer should be among the team of employees that you hire before you start your company.

There are small to large scale businesses for almost all kinds of industries ranging from day-to-day commodities such as food, shampoo, and potable water to more compound products like gadgets, vehicles, and life insurances. Just name it and the list goes on.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif"><span style="font-size:16px">The thing is we&rsquo;re living in such a competitive world that businesses come and go all the time and we don&rsquo;t even have the slightest idea about it &ndash; let alone heard of it. Just like billions of people who would like to be remembered, businesses are in fact a transient entity. However, there are <a href="http://neladunato.com/blog/ways-logo-can-improve-your-business/" style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline">a number of ways</a> on how you can make it stay &ndash; both in the ever-changing industry and in the hearts of people. At the end of the day it all really comes down to one thing, either you make it or break it.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif"><span style="font-size:16px">Question now is &ndash; how do you make a business stay? Well, lucky for you we have prepared one very effective way. Before anything else, let&rsquo;s examine where you are now, and where you want to be.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif"><span style="font-size:16px"><strong>What Sets You Apart</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif"><span style="font-size:16px">First things first, what do you think sets a business apart from others? It&rsquo;s not really size, sales, or profit. These things help businesses thrive but they don&rsquo;t create distinction. What really sets a business apart is identity. And unfortunately, not all businesses are successful in generating this particular requirement.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif"><span style="font-size:16px">So how do you start creating this so-called identity? Uniqueness, product development, and market knowledge all play a big part but so does priming. In any marketing effort, priming proves to be effective more often than not. It is defined as &ldquo;<a href="http://blog.motivemetrics.com/What-is-Priming-A-Psychological-Look-at-Priming-Consumer-Behavior" style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline">an implicit memory effect in which exposure to a stimulus influences a response to a later stimulus</a>.&rdquo; It comes in a lot of forms which includes online advertisements, images, and wouldn&rsquo;t you guess &ndash;brand logos.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif"><span style="font-size:16px"><strong>Bridge the Gap</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif"><span style="font-size:16px">When you see a big, yellow &ldquo;M&rdquo; against a red background, you know it is McDonald&rsquo;s. When you see a big check mark on a shoe, you know it is Nike. Even that small little &ldquo;f&rdquo; inside a blue box you come across with every time you go tinkering about the internet can lead to a behavioral response &ndash;a response that might promise a future for your business.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif"><span style="font-size:16px">Which brings us to answer the question, why should you opt to invest in a professional logo design? The answer: Identity. And it is not enough to simply have a name. According to an article by starling-design, <a href="http://www.starling-design.com/subliminally-priming-a-logo-can-influence-consumers-behaviour/" style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline">simply gazing at a logo can affect our subsequent behavior.</a> In other words, a logo is powerful enough to stir up influence over the buying public. And choosing the right one, will give you even more advantage.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif"><span style="font-size:16px">Ample research has shown strong evidence of how logos can incite and influence consumer decisions. A blog post by <a href="http://www.popmatters.com/post/how-brands-prime-behavior/" style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline">popmatters</a> even quoted that <em>resistance to behavioral branding is futile; we are affected by logos whether we want to be or not.</em> And it is not an easy escape. You might remember having an experience of seeing a new product commercial then suddenly; it keeps popping everywhere so you become curious enough to buy. That&rsquo;s what makes it <a href="http://brightbluec.com.au/index.php/blog/article/why_your_logo_really_is_important" style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline">powerful</a>. Most of the meddling is done subconsciously and all it takes is repetition and constant exposure to triggers.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif"><span style="font-size:16px">Logo designs are made specific to one identity.

Designers are working every day to develop tools that will help in creating a smooth and seamless experience for their customers. Various elements that did not shape the design industry in the earlier days of pencil and paper are entering the markets every day with most of them relying heavily on the use of technology to remain relevant. Texture is one of the many design elements that the present day designers must use in their designs to make them more visually appealing. A professional designer knows how to use texture to create the desired feel of their designs.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in"><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif"><span style="font-size:16px">Graphic designing involves a proper balance of various elements such as texture, colors, patterns, and shapes among others. All these components amplify each other, and a deficient of one can lead to a poor design. Technological advancements have allowed development of tools that aid in achieving a proper balance of these elements. The change of designing methods from the old-fashioned pen and paper to the use of computers and software such as Adobe Illustrator has brought up a new set of tools that allow the creation of illusionistic texture. </span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in"><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif"><span style="font-size:16px"><strong>Why Apply Texture on Graphic Designs </strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in"><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif"><span style="font-size:16px">A texture is associated with a sense of feel, which draws all the viewers&rsquo; physical and mental attention to the graphics. This means adding it to graphic designs can relay a particular message and inspire desirable emotions to your target clients. Designers have been using texture to create contrasting features on graphical pieces. They have also used it to add a visual intrigue on designs that make any 3D or 2D graphical piece appear more real. Professional designers recognize the importance of bringing depth to a design and highlighting the relevant features of their work.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in"><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif"><span style="font-size:16px"><strong>Actual Vs. Visual Texture</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in"><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif"><span style="font-size:16px">We experience texture by touching and feeling the degree of roughness or smoothness on an item. Therefore, a designer can either choose between using <a href="https://www.thoughtco.com/texture-in-graphic-design-1697500" style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline">real or actual texture and the visual or implied texture</a>. The real texture is different from other design elements since you can feel the <a href="http://abduzeedo.com/using-texture-get-most-out-design" style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline">texture</a> with your hands as it appears on the designed items. Designers apply visual texture by creating a design to look like something it is not by using rich, layered graphics, computers, and software.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in"><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif"><span style="font-size:16px">&nbsp;</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif"><span style="font-size:16px"><strong>Actual Texture</strong></span></span></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p style="margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in"><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif"><span style="font-size:16px">This texture is limited to the paper-based items such as business cards and product labels. The choice of the paper and material, its feel, and weight has a direct influence on the quality of a design. This means an embossed business card may be of a better quality than the one from plain paper. A high quality and textured paper may come with a higher cost than the plain papers. Therefore, you may consider looking at the affordability of the textured paper versus the image you intend to create. </span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<ol start="2">\r\n	<li><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif"><span style="font-size:16px"><strong>Visual Texture</strong></span></span></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p style="margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in"><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif"><span style="font-size:16px">Visual textures just made it easy to achieve the intended effect that you need on your graphics without much effort. You just need to create a proper balance of texture either on the background or as an overlay and voila. The designer invents the feel that they want on their designs using layers of texts and shaped and then makes it appear like real. They may also use a combination of photography, fine art and design software to come up with visually appealing textures. </span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in"><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif"><span style="font-size:16px"><strong>Conclusion</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in"><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif"><span style="font-size:16px">Both actual and visual textures are important in the designing industry. Sometimes it may be impossible to use a real texture on design, but you have an alternative of evoking your desired feel using visual texture. Texture may only be a visual thing, but it can give life to what would otherwise be a poor quality design.

This is the reason why <a href="https://www.graphicszoo.com/pages/posts/21" style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline">Facebook posts with pictures</a> get shared more often &ndash; or in the case of twitter, re-tweeted.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in; text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif"><span style="font-size:16px">&nbsp;For instance, you have an attending audience of 1000 people.
